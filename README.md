# Intersection Observer Example

A modern web application built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**, compiled using **Vite**, that demonstrates the power of the Intersection Observer API to create seamless and efficient user experiences.

## Key Features:

1. **Infinite Scrolling**  
   - Dynamically fetches character data from the **Rick and Morty API** using **SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate)** for optimized data fetching and caching.  
   - As users scroll, new content is automatically loaded, providing a smooth and uninterrupted browsing experience.

2. **Lazy Loading Images**  
   - Character images are lazy-loaded to ensure only images within the user's viewport are loaded.  
   - This approach reduces bandwidth usage and enhances overall performance.

## Technology Stack:
- **Framework**: React  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS  
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript  
- **Compiler**: Vite  
- **Data Fetching**: SWR
